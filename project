###Introduction 
Tampa weather is constantly changing throughout the year. I think the main factor 
for weather in Tampa is the temperature. If it's really hot you're going to get rain. If it's in the colder months your not going to get as much rain.

```{r}
head(mydata)
```

This shows the amount of rain every day in Tampa in 2016 and the max temperature
and minimum temperature.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mydata)
geom_bar(aes(x = precipitation, y = month))
```

###conclusion 
The hotter months had more rain then the colder months.
